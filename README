Chibichan is a very tiny Danbooru style image gallery.

It is not at all based on Danbooru except for styling.

Chibichan as its name implies is designed to be small,
and also probably used for very small deployments.

Chibichan is also not done at all.


HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Copy all files to your directory.
2. Set your directory to be writable.
3. Drag and drop files into the directory with the files here.


ROAD MAP

Current Capacity:
-Display all the images in the current directory
-Create and use thumbnails for these images
-Infinite width display page
-Each image opens to its own information page.
-Flat file database
-Tagging
-Sorting by tags

Planned:
-Negated Tag Sorting
-Slideshow based off query
-Password protected upload/editing

Would be nice:
-Bulk tag editing
-Security Review
-Comment the code a bit
-Magic Number removal
-- Creating them at all is a bad habit, I know

Maybe Eventually:
-User based upload/editing
-Cleanup and refactor code
-Allow Commenting
-Allow tag categorization


The first one to cleanup and refactor this code becomes my new best friend.
