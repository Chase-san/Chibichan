Chibichan is a very tiny Danbooru style image gallery.

It is not at all based on Danbooru except for styling.

Chibichan as its name implies is designed to be small,
and also probably used for very small deployments.

Chibichan is also not done at all.


HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Copy all files to your directory.
2. Set your directory to be writable.
3. Drag and drop files into the directory with the files here.
